                <h3 class="storymap">My family has been involved in the formation of many areas. From the trek from England to the states of Utah and Idaho, and eventually the USA. One such individual is of particular significance and is my 3rd-great-grandfather who is from. His name is John Jones Williams. On my trek I walked in his name, and I learned many things about him before and after. His story has special significance to me because of this. Before he came to the US he worked by shoeing horses, where he worked directly for the king. He became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and traveled to Utah. His expertise with metalworking was useful for repairs and other such needs as he traveled across the plains to Utah. He eventually was able to move to Malad, Idaho (a place he had visited before) and helped to survey and build up the town. He was respected as the best blacksmith around, and if he couldn’t do it, then nobody would bother to try. He is “credited for making the first steel plow used in the Salt Lake Valley” All in all, John Jones Williams’ work ethic, kindness and caring for others allowed him to be able to make a huge difference in the lives of those around him.</h3>
