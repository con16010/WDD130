      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is where I want to display any general information and images. This is where things like a family crest will go. I would love to have pictures of extended family if possible, though it may not be. I would really like for there to be a story or two on the home page. These stories can just be things that relatives have done to shape the world, or a heartfelt and personal story instead. The idea behind this page is to give a brief history of my family from the beginning up to the point that I can tell my individual familyâ€™s story.

        <img src="images/family2.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Parents</h3>
      <p>
        This is where I would want to go more in depth and talk about traditions that my family has had. I would love to have a few stories of amazing or impressive things that my parents have done. I want a shortened story of how they met/engaged, and stories of that nature. Some of this I could do with bullet points, others I would have to write in an essay format. The point of this page is to have a place that I can add onto and create more and more stories as time goes on. This is also a place where I can get funny stories to add in as well.

      </ul>
      <h3>Wife and Kids</h3>
      <p>
        This is the page reserved for my family. This is where I want to give an overview of the details of my wife and my life. This would be fun to have an overview of details before we were in High School together. This would also be fun to have a couple of stories from our missions. A large part of why this would be fun to work on is because there are many stories that we never shared (experienced together). This would be an area where we can learn more about each other and grow closer together as a family. There would also be a spot for my daughter that was recently born. This would be a spot that would be fun to have stories such as her birth, and things of that nature. I do not feel comfortable putting information of her birth and things like that on the internet at this point. This section will be strictly story based. This will also be the latter or bottom half of the page.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page will be for pictures with family, and may even include extended family. The text boxes in the middle top and the edges are for fun facts about my family, general information, and for my wife's family as well.      </p>
      </p>
      <img src="images/home.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Parents</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will be reserved for my parents. This is where there will be information about my parents, and possibly even a story. This is split with either parent being at the top half or bottom half of the page.
      </p>
      <img src="images/parents.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>Wife and Kids</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is specifically for me, my wife, and our daughter. The top half is meant to be for me to share about my sife and I. The bottom half is to talk about our daughter.
