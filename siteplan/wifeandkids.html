                <h2>This is a picture of my wife and I when she was about 4 months pregnant. We were at her sister's house in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</h2>
                <h3>My wife caught my attention all the way back when we were both in high school. There was no one action that attracted me to her, but a constant kindness. We would often have lunch together at the “Mormon” table (as it was called by us back then). Everyday she would offer to take everyone’s trash from their lunches to the garbage can. She would always care for and always look out for others. Other than being the most beautiful woman in the room, this constant selflessness is what attracted me to her.</h3>

                <h4>This picture was taken just before we left the hospital with our new daughter Madilyn just after Christmas 2022!</h4>
                <h5>My daughter is almost 2 months old. I have never been really close to a family that has recently had a child, and this was very new to me. Overall, the birthing experience was about as easy as it could be. Even though it was relatively very easy, I knew that it was a challenge for my wife. I never knew how strong she could be because there hasn’t been a time where it has been needed. I never understood how much work, pain and love goes into having a baby until my wife was able to show me how strong she was.</h5>
